@model CommandCentral.Email.Models.CorrespondenceShared

Hello @Model.To.ToDisplayName()!

The list of people that correspondence @Model.CorrespondenceItem.SeriesNumber is shared with has changed!

Added people:
@foreach (var person in Model.Added)
{
    <text>@person.ToDisplayName()</text>
}

Removed people:
@foreach (var person in Model.Removed)
{
    <text>@person.ToDisplayName()</text>
}

Final "Shared With" list after changes:
@foreach (var person in Model.CorrespondenceItem.SharedWith)
{
    <text>@person.ToDisplayName()</text>
}

Note: If a person is involved in a correspondence (as a reviewer, for example), then that person's presence on the "Shared With" list does not matter as the correspondence is always considered to be shared with that person.
