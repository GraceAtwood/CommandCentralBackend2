Hello @Model.To.ToDisplayName()!

The correspondence @Model.CorrespondenceItem.SeriesNumber is no longer being shared with you!

Note: If you are involved in the correspondence (as a reviewer, for example), then whether or not the correspondence is "shared" with you is immaterial as it is always considered to be shared with you.
